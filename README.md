# TimThumb Image Resizer

TimThumb is a simple, flexible, lightweight PHP script that resizes images. You provide it with a set of parameters, and it outputs a thumbnail image that you can display on your site. One of its standout features is its straightforward functionality which makes it a great choice for developers looking for an easy-to-use image resizing solution.

TimThumb has seen a massive amount of use across the WordPress world, and a few months after its release, [Ben Gillbanks](https://github.com/binarymoon) took over development from Tim, who is a friend of Darren Hoyts. Darren Hoyts is the individual who created the original script. Since Ben took over, there have been a whole host of changes, bug fixes, and additions, making TimThumb more secure and robust.

Around the year 2010, Ben has distanced himself from the development of TimThumb. The difficulties in addressing security concerns led to a stagnation in development, although it's important to note that an alternative, phpThumb, also had serious vulnerabilities pointed out on several occasions, indicating that TimThumb was not particularly vulnerable in comparison. The complex and large-scale nature of phpThumb might cause hesitation in updating to a safer latest version. On the other hand, updating TimThumb is as simple as overwriting a single file.

Due to these reasons, I have taken over the source code and continue to make improvements to TimThumb. I hope to see an increase in TimThumb users moving forward.
